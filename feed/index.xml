										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BNP organized a black flag rally to demand one-point demand including increase in commodity prices, release of all royal prisoners including chairperson Khaleda Zia, withdrawal of all false cases and annulment of the illegal parliament. This is the big program of BNP after the 12th National Parliament election held on January 7.</p>
<p>Gayeshwar Chandra Roy said, we want to bring down this government through democratic movement in a peaceful process. Today the prices of goods have increased tremendously. The people of the country are disoriented. Lack of house to house. Day laborers cannot eat two meals full as before. </p>
<p>He said, the country has been crippled economically. And they have elected to protect the constitutional continuity. In fact, this continuity is due to their looting and grand corruption. 10 lakh crores have been smuggled. But those who have smuggled do not deny it. Which is led by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Gayeshwar said that the Ganobhaban held frequent meetings after announcing the election. Trinamool party did. But the goat ate that too. Today 7 percent people did not go to vote. Again, they voted by themselves with the ID cards of the law enforcement officers. The government forced privileged people to vote with cards. But nothing but foxes and dogs were found in the polling station.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>General Secretary of Awami League and Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that this government is the elected government of the people. China, Russia and India can be our friends. But no foreign power put us in power. The game of election is over, now the game of politics will be played. Corruption, communalism, strike-blockade and fire will be played against terrorism. </p>
<p>Obaidul Quader said these things while speaking as the chief guest at the peace and democracy rally organized by the Dhaka Metropolitan South Awami League in front of the party&#8217;s central office at Bangabandhu Avenue in the capital on Saturday. A large number of leaders and activists participated in this rally organized on the day of black flag march of BNP and its allies. The ruling party staged another showdown in the capital through this post-election peace rally.  </p>
<p>On behalf of Obaidul Quader&#8217;s party, announcing the program of peace and democracy rally on January 30 across the country, he said that on that day, the leaders and activists will hold peace and development rallies in cities, districts and upazilas holding red and green flags. They will be on alert. We can no longer allow the sectarian evil called BNP to grow. The pro-independence forces must unite and confront them.</p>

He said, those who have resigned, they are welcome if they form a new party. This bodes well for democracy. But if the sponsor is Roshan Ershad, it remains to be seen.</p>
<p>There was tension in Japan even before the election. It has increased after the January 7 election landslide. Several senior leaders including Co-Chairman Kazi Feroze Rasheed have lost their posts after criticizing the leadership of Japa Chairman GM Quader for taking part in the election only after getting concession of seats from Awami League for his wife Sherifa Quader.</p>
<p>Several candidates of the party withdrew from the election before the polls. Their complaint was that GM Quader received money from the government for participating in the elections. He did not take notice of the candidates put to the vote. Opposition has gained a new dimension with the news that Sherifa Kader, who lost his bail in the last election, will go to the 12th Parliament in the reserved seat. In a press conference led by the ousted presidium member Shafiqul Islam, Japa announced the resignation of about 700 leaders at the metropolitan, police station and ward levels</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four hundred and fifty bawalis of Bagerhat make a living by cutting and selling the leaves of round trees of Sundarbans. However, Golpata has to be collected as per the time fixed by the forest department. Fishermen will start collecting golpata from the morning of January 28 (Sunday) this year. Will continue till March 31. On Sunday morning, the Bawalis will go to the Sundarbans with the permission (pass-permit) from the forest department. In the meantime, they have completed all kinds of preparations to collect golpata.</p>
<p>Bawali Mozammel Howladar, a resident of South Char of Mongla, who has been making a living by extracting gol leaves for 13 years, said, &#8220;We have made boats, buses, ropes and sharp knives to go to cut gol leaves. I will go to Sundarbans with permission from the forest department.</p>
<p>Bawali Siddiqur Rahman of Matherpar area of â€‹â€‹Sharankhola said that every year the boat needs to be repaired before the collection of golpata. Golpata does not work like before. Good prices are not available. As the price of everything has increased, it is difficult to run the family. Even so, to sustain the profession, I go to cut golpata every year. Besides, the boats are made in a special way for extracting Golpata. Due to which the boat has to be abandoned after the season of golpata extraction is over. He said that because of leaving, extra money is spent for repairs every year.</p>

The two winning independent candidates sitting on the dais also said the election was fair and peaceful. There is no objection to a peaceful rally-meeting. It will not be tolerated if you are riotous, start fire, do anything that causes public unrest. Nothing will be allowed to disturb the peace of the people.</p>
<p>The minister also said, &#8216;I am grateful and indebted to the people of Brahmanbaria for the love they showered on me. Father of the Nation Bangabandhu gave us a country. The country is moving forward under the leadership of his daughter Sheikh Hasina. You have won me over. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasin made me a minister. I seek prayers from the people of the district, that I can fulfill the responsibility that has been given to me properly. I will fulfill the promise that I have made. Earlier I was against extortionists, robbers, land robbers, drug dealers, and I am still today. I want to tell the drug dealers that because of you my youth is going to ruin, I can&#8217;t let them go to ruin. So zero tolerance against drug dealers.</p>
